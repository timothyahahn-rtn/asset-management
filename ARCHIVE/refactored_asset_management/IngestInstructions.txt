All files are copied to the {$edex_home}/data/ooi/xasset_spreadsheet folder for ingest.

Order of ingest.

The calibration data are associated with asset entries in the bulk load, so the bulk-load
file must be ingested before any may be processed.
The information in the CruiseInformation file is used, but not mandatory, for ingesting deployment
data. If the cruise information is not available, the cruise information entries in deployments
will be left blank. They may be added at a later time by editing the deployment after the cruise information
has been added.

  The bulk_load-AssetRecord.csv or CruiseInformation.xlsx files may be added in any order.

  The *_Deploy.xlsx and *_Cal_Info.xlsx files may then be added.
